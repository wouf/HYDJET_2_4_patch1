Install the ROOT package (http://root.cern.ch/) and ensure the ROOTSYS environment variable is set. Add the ROOT installation directory to $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. e.g. 
                     ROOTSYS=$HOME/ROOT/root
                     PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
                     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

Run "make" for ROOT tree output
Run "make histo" for ROOT histogram output.
 
This will create the executable file "HYDJET" (or "HYDJET_HISTO") in the same 
directory. Once the program is compiled, one can use the executables above 
to start a simulation run. The input file necessary to run HYDJET++ must always 
be named "RunInputHydjet", so after preparing this file one can start the 
simulation with the command line: 
"./HYDJET" (for ROOT tree output), or 
"./HYDJET_HISTO" (for ROOT histogram output). 
If an output file is not specified then the event records will be automatically 
directed to the file "RunOutput.root" (or "RunOutputHisto.root").
(see DOC/hydjet++.txt).

The .root files produced by HYDJET and HYDJET_HISTO can be viewed using the C++ 
programs (macros) stored in the RootMacros directory.
